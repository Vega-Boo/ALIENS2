You the player are charged with defending the planet from an oncoming fleet of aliens trying to abduct your colonists. Shoot them down as they approach the planet from all sides and hold out for as long as possible.

This is a short and snappy arcade game I made for my year 2 HND Games Development course at Edinburgh College and is a spiritual successor to the game I made the previous year. Inspired by Williams Electronics Defender, I made it using the Monogame engine.
